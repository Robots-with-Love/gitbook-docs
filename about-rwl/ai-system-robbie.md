Robbie is RwL AI teacher.

She is made up of a variety of AI's working together. Eventually Robbie will run autonomously and locally, but she is currently made up of off the shelf services.

* Otter.ai - Recording of information and organization
* Claude.ai - Scripts and Design
* Eleven Labs - Voice Over - Robbie is a custom voice design.
* Stable Diffusion - Character Design and Assets.

As Robbie is constructed, her code and data sets will be open sourced, and recorded through the blockchain, for ownership of the community.
